Usage:

  - run the app to build a graph. It'll save to graph.json, and load from that file next time.
  - if you've got graphviz installed, it'll save an svg to the same dir as your graph file with the .svg extension.
  - if you've got an auto-reloading svg viewer, use it! eg https://apps.apple.com/app/coteditor/id768053424
